# Gofer
Gofer is a project/task management solution for organisations. Users can be assigned to projects which have tasks under them. Authorization is handled through a Roles based system, the organisation admin can create roles and assign various rights to them, these rights govern what actions users with certain roles can perform.

**Note:** This project is currently under development.

## Highlights
- Built using the `MERN` stack (MongoDB + Express + React + Node)
- GraphQL API ([Schema](https://github.com/ShardulNalegave/gofer/blob/main/schema.gql))
- Token-based auth using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
